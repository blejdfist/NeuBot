_______________ y_serial :: Warehouse compressed Python objects with SQLite

  Dependencies:  at least Python v2.5 because it includes the sqlite3 module. 
                 Database itself and all other modules used are standard issue.

The purpose of y_serial is to keep data persistent outside of impermanent
memory.  It is based on a key/value system where the conceptual key
=(database_filename + table_name + unique_primary_key + timestamp + user_notes);
the value is some general object; and the system is implemented using a SQL
database.  Our goal is have the simplest possible interface in the foreground,
yet have near optimal computing in the background.  

By "objects" we generally mean Python objects, but we include support for files
(binary, image, etc.) and URL content (e.g. webpages).  Python objects are
strings, dictionaries, lists, tuples, classes, and instances.  Objects are
inserted into this hierarchy: database file, table within that database, row
within table.  Moreover, each object is annotated for reference by "notes" and
automatically timestamped.

To minimize storage size, each object is compressed (zlib). Before compression,
we serialize the object (cPickle). The processing between y_serial and the
database is handled by sqlite3 (all modules are standard issue).  Your program's
interaction with y_serial normally will not require writing SQL (although
subqueries can be customized). 

We recommend SQLite because it requires neither separate installation nor a
server process; also, it uses single normal files (easy to backup or send), not
an elaborate filesystem. Moreover, in comparison to similar applications with
MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is extremely fast and suits most purposes
wonderfully. Should you later decide to migrate out of SQLite, y_serial can
help port your objects elsewhere including other NoSQL implementations.

Surprisingly our module is faster than comparable approaches under PostgreSQL.
Among serialization methods, we found cPickle to be one of the fastest, and so
we have used it in a secure manner. Try it out with a few million objects. 

The notes identify the objects placed into the database.  They should include
keywords and tags.  We can then later query the database, for example, by
"regex" (regular expression) searching on notes, and placing the qualified
objects in a dictionary.  The keys of this dictionary correspond to the unique
primary keys used in the database. If necessary we can access the timestamp for
each object.  We can thus use Python code to process the contents of the
qualified dictionary, in effect, a data subset.  If the objects in that
dictionary are themselves dictionaries we are in effect storing schema-less data
(see the compelling Friendfeed case study for this in the Endnotes which also
includes other supporting material).

y_serial is written as a single Python module which reads like a working
tutorial and includes many tips and references.  Hopefully you will notice that
many of the fine protocol details about cursor/connection, SQL/DB-API
implementation, serialization, and compression are optimized for speed,
security, concurrency -- yet handled in the background, transparently. 

Here's a quick EXAMPLE for a typical situation. First create an instance which
is associated with some database file: 

     import y_serial_v052 as y_serial
     demo = y_serial.Main( '/tmp/agency.sqlite' )
     #  ^instance          ^include suitable path for database file
     #             Now we do some work producing an object obj, e.g.  
     obj = 911
     # --------------------------------------------------------------
     demo.insert( obj, "#plan agent007 #london", 'goldfinger' )
     #                                            ^table
     #                  ^append text notes to each object.
     #     Such notes can be arbitrarily long, and should contain 
     #     keywords or tags (UTF-8 supported).
     # --------------------------------------------------------------
     #     ... some time later, perhaps in another script: 
     #
     eg1 = demo.select( "agent00[1-7],#plan", 'goldfinger' )
     #                   ^search values, comma separated, 
     #                    arbitrarily many permitted in string.
     print "Example 1:  ", eg1
     #            That retrieved the latest goldfinger plan which 
     #            involves any one of the top seven agents.
     #
     #  That's it... only a few lines of code to store compressed 
     #  serialized objects in a SQL database, and to selectively 
     #  retrieve them (without much SQL fuss, but with optional 
     #  regular expression).   DEAD SIMPLE!
     #
     # ============================================================== 

     #               Let's add an object for agent006
     obj = 411
     demo.insert( obj, "agent006 #paris #plan", 'goldfinger' )
     #
     #     We now can get a dictionary of objects
     #     which matches our search values:
     eg2 = demo.selectdic( "agent00[1-7],#plan", 'goldfinger' )
     print "Example 2:  ", eg2
     #         which should look like:
     #     {1: [1257874696, u'#plan agent007 #london', 411], 
     #      2: [1257874696, u'agent006 #paris #plan', 911]   }
     #
     #  The dictionary keys also are the primary keys used in the 
     #  database. Inside the list are the (unix) epoch timestamp, 
     #  followed by (unicode) notes, then object. We can thus 
     #  work with data subsets using Python code (not SQL).
     #
     #  Instead of using comma separated values, we could have 
     #  easily crafted a subquery and used a method called dicsub.
     #  Or NO subquery whatsoever...
     #     the most recent n-th entry can be picked out by:
     eg3 = demo.select( 0, 'goldfinger' )
     print "Example 3:  ", eg3
     #
     #          The method view is verbose and will pretty print
     #          deeply nested structures:
     demo.view( 5, 'goldfinger' )
     #          ^last m inserts (alternative: use search string).
     # ============================================================== 

     #          y_serial can also perform like a persistent QUEUE.
     #          Whenever that is retrieved (including dictionaries) 
     #          can be deleted thereafter simply by appending 
     #          POP=True at the end of any applicable method.
     eg4 = demo.select( 0, 'goldfinger', POP=True )
     #
     #     demo.fifo('goldfinger') is the traditional FIFO queue
     #          where the oldest object is retrieved then deleted.
     #
     #          Next example directly deletes objects:
     demo.delete( "agent00?", 'goldfinger' )
     #          whose notes mention any single digit agent.
     # --------------------------------------------------------------
     #          To get rid of stale material, we could 
     #          freshen the table and vacuum the database:
     demo.clean( 365.5 , 'goldfinger' )
     #           ^one year-old or less, prior to last insert.
     #          To delete the entire table, use:
     demo.droptable( 'goldfinger' )

Other useful methods are offered, for example: insert by filename (via infile),
by URL (via inweb), or by generator (via ingenerator which can be used to store
thousands of computationally intense results for fast retrieval at a later
time).  Copy functions are provided which are then used to code for a 
farm of databases...

In heavy concurrent situations (hundreds of near-simultaneous writes per
second), SQLite has a problem because of the way it locks the database.  
We alleviate the problem by diffusing such operations across many databases 
(called barns via class Farm), and then writing back to the target database 
as a batch (far more efficient than single writes) diffused over time. The 
harvest time to reap the batch is stochastic (see the plant method). That 
introduces some latency in accessing the newest objects -- the cost for 
scaling up concurrency. The Farm is currently in beta. 

For most practical purposes, the class Main should be reasonably suitable.

_______________  CHANGE LOG

     2009-11-22  v0.52:  Added plant (insert) method summarizing class Farm.

     2009-11-19  v0.51:  Added fifo (queue) method to class Oldest.
                         Added beta Farm (of databases!) for concurrency.

  !! 2009-11-11  v0.50:  TOTAL TOP-DOWN GENERALIZED CLASS REWRITE
                    of the final bottom-up all-function revision 28.

          - Python objects now are warehoused among various database files 
               by design. Each instance of the class Main is associated with 
               a particular database file.
          - Dropped *glob functions in favor of the *comma form (see 
               comma2list to see how this works exactly). 
          - Simplified the names of many functions since most of them 
               are now methods within some class. 
          - LIFO has been renamed as POP to reflect queue generlization.

     2009-10-26  Revision 28: final bottom-up all-function version 
                    which also archives prior change log.

  !! = indicates change(s) which broke backward compatibility.

#  What problem does y_serial solve beyond serialization?
#  
#       "pickle reads and writes file objects, it does not handle the 
#       issue of naming persistent objects, nor the (even more complicated) 
#       issue of concurrent access to persistent objects. The pickle module 
#       can transform a complex object into a byte stream and it can 
#       transform the byte stream into an object with the same internal 
#       structure. Perhaps the most obvious thing to do with these byte
#       streams is to write them onto a file, but it is also conceivable 
#       to send them across a network or store them in a database." 
#            http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html


#  y_serial takes a couple of minutes to write a MILLION annotated objects  
#           (that includes serialization and compression),
#           which will consume at least 37MB for a single sqlite file, 
#           on a rather antiquated 32-bit commodity desktop, 
#           blink of an eye for read access using GLOB regex.
#           Generally much faster than comparable DB-API use with PostgreSQL.


#  "To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a Filesystem?
#                           by Russell Sears; Catharine Van Ingen; Jim Gray
#       Paper submitted on 26 Jan 2007 to http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0701168 
#  
#  This paper looks at the question of fragmentation [...] objects smaller than
#  256KB are best stored in a database while objects larger than 1M are best 
#  stored in the filesystem. Between 256KB and 1MB, the read:write ratio and 
#  rate of object overwrite or replacement are important factors." 
#  
#       Generally speaking, database queries are faster than file opens,  
#       however, filesystems are optimized for streaming large objects.
#       That paper shows how important it is to keep a lean database, 
#       which is why we wrote the sqliteclean function. 
#
#       Objects under 1MB will do fine since they will be compressed 
#       before insertion into the database. If you have many larger objects, 
#       we included the alternative gzip compressed file solution.

#  ================== DATABASE versus FILE.gz ======================= 
#
#       Putting all pz objects into a file would be suitable 
#       where the collection of such objects is fairly static 
#       and not so large in quantity. Use a database like 
#       SQLite or PostgreSQL if:
#            - the situation is dynamic, i.e. pz objects need
#                 to be appended or deleted often.
#            - particular pz objects are needed
#                 (using files, all pz objects have to be
#                 unpacked, then picked over).
#            - the database can annotate or index the contents of 
#                 of pz objects (use SQL to then cherry-pick).
#            - the objects are generally under 1MB; see Endnotes.

#  Why BLOB dictionaries for storing schema-less data?
#  
#       * Dictionaries are very suitable objects 
#         which are variable length, arbitrarily nestable, 
#         and can contain arbitrary objects...
#
#       Bret Taylor wrote a wonderful post about how Friendfeed uses 
#       MySQL to store schema-less data, 
#       http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql 
#       which got me thinking about the details and its use for 
#       any Python program.  (Thanks very much, Bret! ;-)
#
#       Friendfeed uses a database with schema-less data, where 
#       dictionaries are zlib-pickled and then inserted into MySQL. 
#       Other tables then index the primary. Easier to shard, and 
#       avoids JOINs -- thus conceptually, python code on the 
#       dictionary structure replaces SQL code. The database 
#       merely becomes a fancy hash table with fast access.
#       Nice for rapid development because dictionaries are 
#       easily modifiable and themselves have fast key access.
#       Better for database load distribution and maintenance, 
#       plus it avoids scary table conversions requiring downtime.


#  "Stop calling me NoSQL" by Dhananjay Nene

# 
#       You see unlike RDBMS, I don't require that data be clearly 
#       split into tables, columns and rows. I can work with data the way 
#       it is most naturally represented:  as a tree of individual data 
#       fields, lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc. Also I do not require 
#       that you always clearly define each and every possible schema
#       element before being able to store data corresponding to the 
#       schema. I can happily accept a schema dynamically or even 
#       work without a schema. Some of my early forms were based on 
#       key value pairs stored as B-Trees (eg. Berkeley DB).  Over the 
#       years people have figured out ways to represent the data as 
#       a set of decomposed document elements, store data spread across 
#       a cluster, replicate it for better availability and fault tolerance, 
#       and even perform post storage processing tasks using map-reduce 
#       sequences.  But really what separates me from my cousin and other 
#       storage systems is that I don't make demands on the data -- I take 
#       it in its naturally found form and then store it, replicate it, 
#       slice it, dice it and glean information out of it. And therein 
#       lies my true identity -- I will work with data the way the data 
#       is best represented with all its arbitrary inconsistencies and 
#       inabilities to always clearly specify a constraining schema.



#  What can the PICKLE/cPickle module store? and what about json?
#  
#      * All the native datatypes that Python supports: booleans, integers, 
#           floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, bytes objects, 
#           byte arrays, and None.
#      * Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets containing 
#           any combination of native datatypes.
#      * Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets containing any combination of 
#           lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets containing any combination 
#           of native datatypes (and so on, to the maximum nesting level 
#           that Python supports).
#      * Functions, classes, and instances of classes (with CAVEATS):
#           pickle can save and restore class instances transparently, 
#           however the class definition must be importable and live in the 
#           same module as when the object was stored.  picklable functions 
#           and classes must be defined in the top level of a module.
#                [ Most likely reason why pzget gets CHOKED. 
#                  (Hack: insert the defining text, then exec it later.) ]
#  
#      Good reference: http://diveintopython3.org/serializing.html
#      Also includes a comparative review of the json module 
#      introduced as of Python v2.6 -- which is text-based serialization.
#
#           _____ json versus pickle 
#            Few reasons why we opted for pickle instead of json:
#            - human-readability is not a primary concern
#                 since the database could care less.
#            - json does not distinguish between tuples and lists.
#            - json cannot handle complex Python objects 
#                 without additional en/decoding.
#                 (and why worry about internal structures?)
#            - since json uses utf-8, this may fail in some cases:
#                 obj == json.loads(json.dumps(obj))
#            - we are not handing off the serialized item 
#                 to be read by another language.
#            - as for SECURITY, we are not accepting any serialized 
#                 item from an untrusted source into the database.
#                 y_serial's particular use of pickle is safe.

#            _____ short digression on pickle security risk
#
#  Generally, never unpickle an untrusted string whose origins are dubious, 
#  e.g. strings read from a socket or public webpage. So should one 
#  sanitize and encrypt such strings before the pickle stage? 
#  No, that would not be necessary.
#  
#       pickle uses a simple stack language that allows the creation 
#       of arbitrary python structures, and execute them. This stack 
#       language allows you to import modules (the 'c' symbol), and 
#       apply arguments to callables (the 'R' symbol), thus causing code 
#       to be run. Combine this with the python built-in methods eval 
#       and compile and you have the perfect vehicle for an 
#       "unpickle attack." 
#
#       For more details, also see excellent article by Nadia Alramli, 
#       http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure
#            [And thanks so much, Nadia, for personally clarifying 
#             the difference between untrusted text string and 
#             the string derived from pickling such a thing.]
#
#  Some naive methods proposed to "encrypt" strings before pickle:
#  
#       import string
#       rot13key = string.maketrans(
#               'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 
#               'NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm')
#       def rot13( text ):
#            '''Because Python v3 will discontinue .encode('rot13')'''
#            return text.translate( rot13key )
#            #  notice that, text == rot13(rot13( text ))
#  
#       #  Also look at: .encode('base64') with .decode('base64') 
#
#  But such effort is misplaced, because the security risk is not pickling 
#  untrusted data, but rather unpickling untrusted pickles.  The malicious
#  person must be in a position to be able to modify the pickle or replace 
#  it somehow (e.g. over a communication channel that is not secure). 
#  Pickles over public channels should be crytographically signed;
#  N. Alramli cites http://mumrah.net/2009/09/making-pythons-pickle-safer/
#
#  Never load untrusted pickle streams. Obey this frequently cited warning: 
#  "Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated 
#  source." 
#              y_serial complies, so don't worry, it's safe ...    
#                       (just keep your database secure from tampering ;-)


#  What does Google use in-house? not json, but rather "PROTOCOL BUFFERS," 
#  http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/pythontutorial.html
#       Very nice for multi-lingual serialization, e.g. with C++ 
#       and Java, but its focus is schema-less messages, 
#       not Python objects.


#  What about YAML?
#       Saw http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML, which apparently 
#       offers "high-level API for serializing and deserializing 
#       native Python objects." In short, we did not have the time 
#       to test its reliability. Speed is relatively slow.


#  In summary, SERIALIZATION methods which are human readable, 
#  e.g. json or YAML, are much more slower than cPickle. 
#  If readability by other languages, e.g. C++ or Java, is 
#  not a necessary requirement, cPickle takes the cake. 


#  SQLite "maximum" number of TABLES
#
#  "The more tables you have, the slower the first query will run
#  and the more memory SQLite will use.  For long-running applications
#  where the startup time is not a significant factor, 100s or
#  1000s of tables is fine.  For a CGI script that starts itself
#  up anew several times per second, then you should try to keep
#  the number of tables below a 100, I think.  -- D. Richard Hipp"
#     http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg14057.html


#  SQLite INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (regarding our kid)
#
#  For performance reasons we did not use the AUTOINCREMENT option 
#  which guarantees kid uniqueness, thus: "the largest ROWID is equal to 
#  the largest possible integer 9223372036854775807 then the database 
#  engine starts picking candidate ROWIDs at random until it finds 
#  one that is not previously used." -- That's a lot of rows!
#
#  Interesting to note that under the hood, "kid" as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY 
#  is just an alias for special column names ROWID, _ROWID_, or OID.


#  SQLite will work great as the database engine for low to medium traffic
#  WEBSITES (which is to say, 99.9% of all websites). Any site that gets 
#  fewer than 100K hits/day should work fine with SQLite.  SQLite has been 
#  demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of traffic.
#  
#       see SQLite Appropriate Uses : http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html


#  SQLite SUBQUERY limits
#
#       The length of the LIKE or GLOB pattern is limited within SQLite to 
#       SQLITE_MAX_LIKE_PATTERN_LENGTH bytes. The default value of this 
#       limit is 50000. A typical computer can evaluate even a pathological 
#       LIKE or GLOB pattern of such size relatively quickly. 
#
#       Tip: the "notes" field could contain TAGS using the hashmark #.
#            That would focus searching for keywords.


#  Python Cookbook, second ed. #7.12. BLOB in SQLite does NOT work:
#
#       "The PySQLite Python extension offers function sqlite.encode 
#       to let you insert binary strings in SQLite databases." 
#       That function has been superceded by sqlite.Binary
#       And now ? replaces %s for more secure syntax.

#  > 
#  >      cursor.execute(sql % (name, password))
#  >      # uh-oh!
#  
#  Of course, that OR 1=1 attack is at the publicly exposed prompt...
#  that clause attaches to the WHERE subquery which is always evaluates true!

#      __________ PARAMETER SUBSTITUTION for sqlite3
#  
#  First how does one find out the substitution style per the DB-API?
#       >>> import sqlite3
#       >>> print sqlite3.paramstyle
#       qmark
#  
#  That means that a question mark "?" is used for SQL parameter substitions, and 
#  the second argument to the execute method is a *sequence* i.e. either a list 
#  or a tuple.  In the latter case, a typical gotcha error is using 
#       (myvariable) instead of (myvariable,) 
#  for a single variable substitution. Thus using a list is easier: [myvariable]
#
#  paramstyle can vary, for example, it's 'pyformat' for psycopg (PostgreSQL).
#  The string attribute paramstyle is apparently read-only.


#           _____ GOTCHA!  Parameter substitution for sqlite3
#  
#  After hours of insanity, I find out this very, very obscure fact:
#                           table names *cannot be parametized* !!
#  Indeed, one could easily think that a table name was a parameter, 
#  but then an injection attempt should not have access to other tables.
#  So be sure to never expose the table variable in public apps.
#
#  It also appears that under strict paramstyle, a placeholder cannot 
#  substitute a WHERE clause. This is very understandable since that's 
#  what a SQL injection attack wants to exploit. 


#  Alex Martelli: "I find the named-parameter binding style much more readable 
#  -- and sqlite3 supports it:
#  
#       c.execute('SELECT * FROM atable WHERE newID=:t', locals())
#  
#  Note: passing {'t': t} or dict(t=t) instead of locals() would be more 
#  punctiliously correct, but in my opinion it would interfere with readability 
#  when there are several parameters and/or longer names."


#      __________ Batch processing (re inbatch)
#
#  SQLite does fsync() 3 times per transaction to guarantee data integrity. 
#  So batch statements update the database in transactions 
#  (BEGIN TRANSACTION; ... COMMIT TRANSACTION;). Only 3 fsync are 
#  required per transaction, not per statement, and one also gets 
#  multi-statement atomicity, so all the changes make it to disk or 
#  none does.  cf. Firefox3 performance hit:
#       http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/
#
#  Richard Hipp concurs: "Using a transaction is the fastest way to 
#  update data in SQLite. After each transaction the SQLite engine 
#  closes and opens the database file. When SQLite opens a database file 
#  it populates the SQLite internal structures, which takes time. 
#  So if you have 100 updates and don't use a transaction then SQlite 
#  will open and close the database 100 times. Using transactions 
#  improves speed. Use them."
#
#  Ok, that said, it would seem to help if we did the following:
#            cur.execute( "BEGIN TRANSACTION" )
#               ... update stuff ...
#            cur.execute( "COMMIT TRANSACTION" )
#  but one should NOT do so, because the sqlite3 module has implicitly 
#  already taken care of this issue when it connects and con.commit()
#  
#       By default, sqlite3 opens transactions implicitly 
#       before a DML statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE), 
#       and commits transactions implicitly before anything other 
#       than (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE).
#  
#       You can control the kind of "BEGIN" statements via the 
#       isolation_level parameter to the connect call,
#       or via the isolation_level property of connections.
#  
#       If you want autocommit mode, then set isolation_level 
#       to None [which does NOT begin transaction].  Otherwise 
#       the default will result in a plain "BEGIN" statement. 
#       One could also set it to an isolation level 
#       supported by SQLite: DEFERRED, IMMEDIATE or EXCLUSIVE.
#
#  y_serial uses IMMEDIATE; the differences are explained here:  
#       http://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html 


#            _____ ENCODE TEXT in UTF-8
#  
#  Gerhard, back in 2007 said about the precursor to sqlite3: 
#       "SQLite databases store text in UTF-8 encoding. If you use pysqlite, 
#       and always use unicode strings, you will never have any problems with 
#       that. pysqlite does not rap on your knuckles if you store arbitrary 
#       encodings in the database, but you will feel sorry once you try to 
#       fetch the data."
#  For y_serial, this does not pertain to the object themselves because 
#  they are BLOBs, but it's relevant to the attached annotation notes.
#
#  [sqlite3 module will return Unicode objects for TEXT. If you wanted 
#   to return bytestrings instead, you could set con.text_factory to str.]


#            _____ converting timestamp ("tunix") into human form
#  
#  We rely on SQLite for time functions but in your own program you may 
#  find these python functions useful to convert unix epoch seconds:
#  
#            import time
#            #            e.g. let tunix = 1254458728
#  
#            def tunixdate( tunix ):
#                 return time.localtime(ticks)[:3]
#                 # e.g. (2009, 10, 1)
#  
#            def tunixclock( tunix ):
#                 return time.localtime(ticks)[3:6]
#                 # e.g. (21, 45, 28)
#  
#            def tunixtuple( tunix ):
#                 return time.localtime(ticks)[:6]
#                 # e.g. (2009, 10, 1, 21, 45, 28)

#  SQLite is a C library that provides a disk-based database that doesn't 
#  require a separate server process.  D. Richard HIPP deserves huge credit 
#  for putting SQLite in the public domain:  solving 80% of data persistance 
#  issues, using only 20% of the effort required by other SQL databases.
#  Thus SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. 


#  The sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard HÄRING and provides a SQL interface 
#  compliant with the Python DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249:
#       http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/                   =======  <=!

#  zlib was written by Jean-loup GAILLY (compression) and Mark ADLER
#  (decompression).  Jean-loup is also the primary author/maintainer of gzip(1);
#  Mark is also the author of gzip's and UnZip's main decompression routines and
#  was the original author of Zip.  Not surprisingly, the compression algorithm
#  used in zlib is essentially the same as that in gzip and Zip, namely, the
#  'deflate' method that originated in PKWARE's PKZIP 2.x.
